# Chapter 2: Basic Scripting
## Lesson 1: Hello World!
Lesson 1 starts with <b>echo</b> and <b>read</b>. <i>echo</i> prints strings on screen, and <i>read</i> takes input from keyboards. When printing a variable in a string with <i>echo</i>, use <b>$</b> to indicate a variable in the string, and be sure to use double quotation for the string.
<br><br>
This lesson contains two files: <i>hello_world.sh</i> to print <i>Hello World!</i> with <b>echo</b>, and <i>name.sh</i>. <i>name.sh</i> will ask your name and print your name after you have entered. To run the script, put this on the command line:

```
sh hello_world.sh
```
